# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a fresh GitHub Pages repository (farboddadkhah.github.io) that appears to be newly initialized with no commits yet. The repository is set up for hosting a personal website on GitHub Pages.

## Repository Structure

- This is an empty repository with only git initialization
- No package.json, build tools, or source files are currently present
- No existing documentation or configuration files

## Development Workflow

Since this is a new repository, the typical workflow would be:

1. **Initial Setup**: Add HTML, CSS, JavaScript files for the website
2. **GitHub Pages**: Content in the main branch will be automatically deployed to https://farboddadkhah.github.io
3. **Static Site**: This appears to be intended as a static website repository

## Common Commands

Since no build system or package manager is configured yet, standard git commands apply:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main
```

## Notes for Future Development

- This repository is ready for initial content creation
- Consider adding a build system (npm, Jekyll, etc.) if dynamic content generation is needed
- GitHub Pages will automatically serve content from the root directory or docs/ folder
- The repository name suggests this is a personal portfolio/website
